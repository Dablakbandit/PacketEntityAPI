## Description
PacketEntityAPI is an API designed to allow simple modification and creation of entities. It provides a listener which fires events whenever packets are sent to modify entities and allows them to be modified.

## Compatibility and Dependencies
PacketEntityAPI currently *requires* ProtocolLib. There are no known incompatibilities.

## Commands and Permissions
PacketEntityAPI does not have any commands or permissions.

## API Usage
PacketEntityAPI is designed as an API. It is not meant to be used as a plugin on its own. API documentation is available [here](http://iso2013.github.io/PacketEntityAPI/javadocs/). To get started, [click here](https://github.com/iso2013/PacketEntityAPI/wiki).
